# Javascript in the browser - Forms

I created a page with a contact form which has four marked required input fields.  

If you click the Submit button without filling in any inputs, the border becomes red and an icon along with red error text appears for each input that is not filled out correctrly.  

Each time you fill out a field, if you click submit again it should give you a success icon and green border or another error and explanation.  

The email field must have an @ surrounded with text followed by a . before the last letter.  
The phone number field must be number and have exactly 7 digits, no spacing.  

If all fields are filled in correctly the html changes to a thank you message and adds a /#thankyou to the end of the url.
